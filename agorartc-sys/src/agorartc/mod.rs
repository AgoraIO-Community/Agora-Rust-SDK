     @param info (Optional) Pointer to additional information about the channel. This parameter can be set to NULL or contain channel related information. Other users in the channel will not receive this message.
     @param uid (Optional) User ID. A 32-bit unsigned integer with a value ranging from 1 to 2<sup>32</sup>-1. The @p uid must be unique. If a @p uid is not assigned (or set to 0), the SDK assigns and returns a @p uid in the \ref IRtcEngineEventHandler::onJoinChannelSuccess "onJoinChannelSuccess" callback.

     This method consumes additional network traffic, and hence may affect communication quality.

     - Do not call any other methods before receiving the \ref IRtcEngineEventHandler::onLastmileQuality "onLastmileQuality" callback. Otherwise, the callback may be interrupted by other methods, and hence may not be triggered.
     - A host should not call this method after joining a channel (when in a call).
     - If you call this method to test the last-mile quality, the SDK consumes the bandwidth of a video stream, whose bitrate corresponds to the bitrate you set in the \ref agora::rtc::IRtcEngine::setVideoEncoderConfiguration "setVideoEncoderConfiguration" method. After you join the channel, whether you have called the `disableLastmileTest` method or not, the SDK automatically stops consuming the bandwidth.

    Call this method to check the uplink network quality before users join a channel or before an audience switches to a host.
    Once this method is enabled, the SDK returns the following callbacks:
    - \ref IRtcEngineEventHandler::onLastmileQuality "onLastmileQuality": the SDK triggers this callback within two seconds depending on the network conditions. This callback rates the network conditions and is more closely linked to the user experience.
    - \ref IRtcEngineEventHandler::onLastmileProbeResult "onLastmileProbeResult": the SDK triggers this callback within 30 seconds depending on the network conditions. This callback returns the real-time statistics of the network conditions and is more objective.

    /** Sets the local voice changer option.

     This method can be used to set the local voice effect for users in a `COMMUNICATION` channel or hosts in a `LIVE_BROADCASTING` channel.
     Voice changer options include the following voice effects:

     - `VOICE_CHANGER_XXX`: Changes the local voice to an old man, a little boy, or the Hulk. Applies to the voice talk scenario.
     - `VOICE_BEAUTY_XXX`: Beautifies the local voice by making it sound more vigorous, resounding, or adding spacial resonance. Applies to the voice talk and singing scenario.
     - `GENERAL_VOICE_BEAUTY_XXX`: Adds gender-based beautification effect to the local voice. Applies to the voice talk scenario.
       - For a male voice: Adds magnetism to the voice.
       - For a female voice: Adds freshness or vitality to the voice.

     @note
     - To achieve better voice effect quality, Agora recommends setting the profile parameter in `setAudioProfile` as `AUDIO_PROFILE_MUSIC_HIGH_QUALITY(4)` or `AUDIO_PROFILE_MUSIC_HIGH_QUALITY_STEREO(5)`.
     - This method works best with the human voice, and Agora does not recommend using it for audio containing music and a human voice.
     - Do not use this method with `setLocalVoiceReverbPreset`, because the method called later overrides the one called earlier. For detailed considerations, see the advanced guide *Voice Changer and Reverberation*.

     @param voiceChanger Sets the local voice changer option. The default value is `VOICE_CHANGER_OFF`, which means the original voice. See details in #VOICE_CHANGER_PRESET.
     Gender-based beatification effect works best only when assigned a proper gender:
     - For male: `GENERAL_BEAUTY_VOICE_MALE_MAGNETIC`.
     - For female: `GENERAL_BEAUTY_VOICE_FEMALE_FRESH` or `GENERAL_BEAUTY_VOICE_FEMALE_VITALITY`.
